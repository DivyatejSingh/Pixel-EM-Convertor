# Pixel-EM-Convertor
To build this project, we need HTML, CSS and Javascript.This converter consists of three input fields.We set its default value to 16. When the user inputs a value in the PX field, he automatically receives the converted EM value in the EM field. Likewise, when the user enters a value in the EM field, it generates the corresponding PX value.
